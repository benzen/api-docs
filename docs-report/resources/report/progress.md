# API Documentation Progress

The progress table below is auto-generated by [this project](https://github.com/cljsinfo/api-docs),
which pieces together the following data sources:

- merged [manual](https://github.com/cljsinfo/api-docs/tree/master/docs) and [generated](https://github.com/cljsinfo/api-docs-generator/tree/docs/docs/) docs
- [API symbol list from CLJS devnotes](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/blob/master/devnotes/corelib.org)
- [scraped clojuredocs examples](https://github.com/cljsinfo/api-docs/tree/examples)

Our goal is to __create the manual docsfile__ for each symbol.  They are highlighted to show progress:

<ul class="legend">
<li><div class="legend-block green-bg">green</div> = file exists with some examples
<li><div class="legend-block yellow-bg">yellow</div> = file exists but missing examples
<li><div class="legend-block red-bg">red</div> = file doesn't exist
<li><div class="legend-block gray-bg">gray</div> = won't document
</ul>

When creating examples, you can start with the [example template](example-template.html),
which will generate a random hash.  The hash will serve as a unique anchor link
on its respective doc page.
