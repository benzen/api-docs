# API Documentation Progress

Our goal is to __create the manual docsfile__ for each symbol.  They are highlighted to show progress:

<ul class="legend">
<li><div class="legend-block green-bg">green</div> = file exists with some examples
<li><div class="legend-block yellow-bg">yellow</div> = file exists but missing examples
<li><div class="legend-block red-bg">red</div> = file doesn't exist
<li><div class="legend-block gray-bg">gray</div> = won't document
</ul>
