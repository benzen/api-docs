cljs.core/loop

===== Signature
[bindings*] body-exprs*

Evaluates the body-exprs in a lexical context in which the symbols in
the binding-forms are bound to their respective init-exprs, just like a 'let' form.
Acts as a 'recur' target, which will allow tail-call optimization.

  (when (> x 1)
    (println x)
    (recur (- x 2))))
```
