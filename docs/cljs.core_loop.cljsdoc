===== Name
cljs.core/loop

===== Signature
(loop [bindings*] 
  expressions*)

===== Description


Evaluates the exprs in a lexical context in which the symbols in
the binding-forms are bound to their respective init-exprs or parts
therein, just like a 'let' form.
Acts as a 'recur' target, which will allow tail-call optimization.

  (when (> x 1)
    (println x)
    (recur (- x 2))))
```
