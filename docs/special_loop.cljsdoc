===== Name
special/loop

===== Signature
[[& bindings] & body-exprs]

===== Description

Evaluates the `body-exprs` in a lexical context in which the symbols in
the binding-forms are bound to their respective init-exprs, just like a `let` form.
Acts as a `recur` target, which will allow tail-call optimization.

(loop [x 0]
  (when (< x 10)
    (println x)
    (recur (+ x 2))))
;; Prints:
;; 0
;; 2
;; 4
;; 6
;; 8

;;=> nil
```
