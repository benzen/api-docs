===== Description

`catch` should be used inside of a `try` expression.

`exception-type` should be the type of exception thrown (usually `js/Error` or
`js/Object`). When there is a match, the thrown exception will be bound to
`name` inside of `expr*` and `expr*` will be evaluated and returned as the value
of the `try` expression.
