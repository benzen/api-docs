===== Name
cljs.core/if

===== Type
special form

===== Signature
[test then else?]

===== Description

If `test` is not false or nil, `then` is evaluated and returned. Otherwise,
`else?` is evaluated and returned. `else?` defaults to nil if not provided.

`if` is one of ClojureScript's [special forms](http://clojure.org/special_forms)
and is a fundamental building block of the language. All other conditionals in
ClojureScript are based on `if`s notion of truthiness (ie: anything other than
false or nil).
