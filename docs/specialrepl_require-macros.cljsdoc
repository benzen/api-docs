===== Name
specialrepl/require-macros

===== Type
special form (repl)

===== Description

Only usable from a REPL.

This is a way for ClojureScript to load macros from Clojure files.
The usage is similar to the `require` form.

There is a nicer alternative if the Clojure macros file has the same name as a
ClojureScript file in the same directory, which is a common pattern.  In this
case, you can just use the `:include-macros` or `:refer-macros` flag of the
`require` form.
