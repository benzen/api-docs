===== Type
syntax

===== Description

(Only intended for use in Clojure macros, which can be used from but not
written in ClojureScript.)

Prevent evaluation of the following form.

Adds namespace-qualification to any symbols inside the following form by
resolving them in the current context.

Any non-namespaced symbols ending with `#` will resolve to a generated symbol
of the same name with `_` and a unique ID appended.  All references to that
symbol within a syntax-quoted expression will resolve to the same generated
symbol.
