===== Name
cljs.core/take-last

===== Signature
[n coll]

===== Description

Returns a sequence of the last `n` items in `coll`.

Depending on the type of collection, `take-last` may be no faster than linear
time. For vectors, please use `subvec`.

===== TODO

Would be nice to list the O(n) time for all the collection types here instead of
just saying "it depends".
