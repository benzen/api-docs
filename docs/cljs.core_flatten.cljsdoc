===== Name
cljs.core/flatten

===== Signature
[x]

===== Description

Takes any nested combination of sequential things (lists, vectors, etc.) and
returns their contents as a single, flat sequence.

`(flatten nil)` returns nil.

===== Example
 
 ```
 (flatten (list 1 2 (list 3 4 (list 5 6 7))))
 ;; => (1 2 3 4 5 6 7)

(flatten nil)
;; => ()
 ```

 ===== TODO
 The description says it returns nil if 'x' is nil.
 But running the second example, we got () for nil.
 Is this normal?
