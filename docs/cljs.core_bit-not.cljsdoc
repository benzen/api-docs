===== Name
cljs.core/bit-not

===== Signature
[x]

===== Description

Bitwise complement.  Same as `~x` in JavaScript.

===== Example#d4c5e3

Bits can be entered using radix notation:

```
(bit-not 2r1100)
;;=> -13
```

Same numbers in decimal:

```
(bit-not 12)
;;=> -13
```

====== TODO

look into how negative numbers are represented in binary (two's complement, but how does this work in JavaScript with floats)
