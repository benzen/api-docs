===== Name
cljs.core/ns

===== Type
special form

===== Signature
[name & references]

===== Description

Sets the namespace of the file.

`ns` must be the first form in a `.cljs` file and there can only be one `ns`
declaration per file. Namespaces must match the file name of their respective
`.cljs` files, with the exception that dashes in namespaces become underscores
in filenames. Thus, `(ns foo.bar-biz.baz)` should be the first form in file
`foo/bar_biz/baz.cljs`.

`references` can be zero or more forms used to import other namespaces, symbols,
and libraries into the current namespace.
